Here is the complete lesson plan for Week 1 of Phase 1.

***

### **Part 1: Weekly Overview**

*   **Weekly Learning Goals:** By the end of this week, students will begin to build their identities as historians and storytellers. They will:
    *   **ELA:** Establish personal reading/writing goals, participate in a community of writers, and practice forming legible cursive letters and words.
    *   **Social Studies:** Locate major physical and man-made features of the United States on a map.
    *   **Math:** Read, write (in standard and expanded form), and compare multi-digit whole numbers up to the hundred-thousands place.
    *   **Science:** Define and model the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers within a simple ecosystem.

*   **Weekly Narrative & Flow:** This week launches our "American Storytellers' Museum" project. We begin by establishing our core tool and identity through the "Storytellers' Notebook," positioning ourselves as active creators, not just passive learners. Mid-week, we transition to becoming geographers and mathematicians, using maps and population data to understand the physical and numerical scale of the United States. We end the week as scientists, exploring the concept of ecosystems, which will serve as a powerful metaphor for understanding historical relationships in later phases. The throughline is "tooling up"â€”gathering the essential skills we need to tell America's stories.

*   **Differentiation & Spiral Review Plan:**
    *   **Differentiation (Support):** Provide sentence starters for notebook reflections. Use pre-labeled or color-coded maps for students needing support with geography. Provide place value charts and manipulatives for math activities. Work in flexible, small groups with teacher check-ins.
    *   **Differentiation (Enrichment):** Challenge students to write more complex reflections or find their own historical quotes for cursive practice. Encourage them to research and map additional US features or compare population data across more than two cities. In the ecosystem activity, they can model a more complex local ecosystem.
    *   **Spiral Review:** Daily warm-ups will review 3rd-grade math concepts (multiplication facts, rounding to the nearest 100) and ELA concepts (identifying nouns, verbs, and adjectives) to build a foundation for the new 4th-grade standards.

### **Part 2: Daily Lesson Plans**

### **Day 1: We Are Storytellers**

*   **Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to set up a personal "Storytellers' Notebook" and write a personal goal for themselves as a reader or writer.
*   **Primary Standard(s) Addressed:** `4.P.EICC.1.a` (Generate... goals), `4.P.EICC.1.b` (Discuss... preferences), `4.P.EICC.1.f` (Develop independence).
*   **Materials:**
    *   Composition notebooks (one per student)
    *   Pre-printed "All About Me as a Reader/Writer" templates and "My Goals" templates
    *   Glue sticks, scissors, colored pencils/markers
    *   Projector to display the project's Essential Question
    *   Anchor chart paper titled "Our Community Norms"

*   **Lesson Plan:**
    1.  **Warm-Up / Introduction (15 min):** Introduce the overall project, "The American Storytellers' Museum," and the Essential Question: *Whose story is it?* Conduct a brief "Think-Pair-Share" on what a story is and who gets to tell them. Explain that this quarter, WE will be the storytellers and historians.
    2.  **Direct Instruction (10 min):** Introduce the "Storytellers' Notebook." Explain that this will be their home base for the entire project. Show an exemplary model you've created. Model how to glue in the first two pages: the "All About Me as a Reader/Writer" template and the "My Goals" template. Think aloud as you fill out a portion of your own, explaining your choices.
    3.  **Guided Practice (20 min):** Students receive their notebooks and templates. Guide them through cutting and gluing the pages neatly. As a class, brainstorm ideas for the "My Goals" section. What makes a good goal? (e.g., "Read 20 minutes every night" is better than "Read more"). Co-create a few example goals on the board.
    4.  **Independent Practice / Activity (30 min):** Students personalize the cover of their notebooks and independently complete the first two pages. Circulate to conference with students about their goals, helping them refine their ideas.
        *   **Differentiation (Support):** Provide sentence starters for goal-setting (e.g., "This quarter, I want to get better at..." or "My reading goal is to..."). Conference with these students first to help them brainstorm.
        *   **Differentiation (Enrichment):** Encourage students to create an illustrated "goals" page or write a more detailed reflection on their identity as a reader/writer on a blank page.
    5.  **Exit Ticket (5 min):** On a sticky note, students write down ONE goal they set for themselves and place it on a "Goals" poster as they leave for recess or lunch. This creates a public, shared commitment.

### **Day 2: Mapping Our Nation's Body**

*   **Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to locate the major physical features of the United States on a map and practice writing a historical quote in cursive.
*   **Primary Standard(s) Addressed:** `SS4G1.a` (Locate major physical features), `4.F.H.4.a` (Form cursive letters and words legibly), `4.F.H.4.b` (Use appropriate spacing).
*   **Materials:**
    *   Large wall map of the USA
    *   Student desk maps or digital map links (e.g., Google Maps)
    *   Storytellers' Notebooks
    *   Projector with a short, powerful historical quote displayed in print and cursive (e.g., "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." - Franklin D. Roosevelt)
    *   Cursive alphabet chart

*   **Lesson Plan:**
    1.  **Warm-Up / Spiral Review (10 min):** "Map Quest!" Project a simple map of your state. Ask students to locate their city, the capital, and a major river or lake. This activates prior knowledge of map skills.
    2.  **Direct Instruction (15 min):** On the large wall map, introduce the six major physical features: Atlantic Coastal Plain, Great Plains, Continental Divide, Gulf of Mexico, Mississippi River, and the Great Lakes. Use clear, simple language to describe each one (e.g., "The Great Plains are huge, flat grasslands in the middle of our country, like a giant's tabletop."). Trace them with your finger or a pointer.
    3.  **Guided Practice (20 min):** Working in table groups with their desk maps, students play "I Spy a Feature." The teacher calls out a feature ("I spy the river that splits our country in two!"), and teams race to find and point to the Mississippi River. Do this for all six features, having students say the names aloud.
    4.  **Independent Practice / Activity (30 min):**
        *   **Part 1 (Geography - 15 min):** Students get a blank or partially labeled map of the U.S. to glue into their notebooks. They must label the six physical features we just learned.
        *   **Part 2 (Cursive - 15 min):** Introduce the "Cursive Quote of the Week." Display the quote and model how to form a few of the cursive letters on the board, referencing a cursive chart. Students then copy the quote carefully into a dedicated section of their Storytellers' Notebook.
        *   **Differentiation (Support):** Provide a map with the features already outlined for easier labeling. For cursive, provide a worksheet with the quote traceable in dotted lines.
        *   **Differentiation (Enrichment):** Challenge students to draw a simple icon for each physical feature on their map (e.g., waves for the Gulf of Mexico, a mountain peak for the Continental Divide). For cursive, they can write a sentence explaining what they think the quote means.
    5.  **Exit Ticket (5 min):** On their map, students circle the feature they think would be the most difficult to cross if they were early settlers. They must be prepared to say why tomorrow.

### **Day 3: Cities and Numbers**

*   **Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to locate six major man-made features and read and write their founding-era populations in standard form.
*   **Primary Standard(s) Addressed:** `SS4G1.b` (Locate major man-made features), `4.NR.1.1` (Read and write multi-digit whole numbers).
*   **Materials:**
    *   Wall map and student maps
    *   Chromebooks or tablets with pre-selected, kid-friendly websites for population data
    *   Storytellers' Notebooks
    *   Place Value anchor chart showing place values up to hundred thousands
    *   Mini-whiteboards and markers

*   **Lesson Plan:**
    1.  **Warm-Up / Spiral Review (10 min):** "Number Talk." Write the number 3,457 on the board. Ask: "What is the value of the 4? What is the value of the 3?" Review place value up to the thousands place.
    2.  **Direct Instruction (15 min):** Using the wall map, locate the six man-made features: NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Gettysburg, and the Erie Canal. Briefly explain the historical significance of each (e.g., "Boston is where many key events leading to the American Revolution happened"). Next, introduce place value to the hundred-thousands place using the anchor chart. Model reading a large number aloud, like 125,430, emphasizing how we say the period name ("one hundred twenty-five *thousand*...").
    3.  **Guided Practice (20 min):** As a class, research the founding-era population of the first city, Boston (around 16,000 in 1775). Write "16,000" on the board. Practice reading it together. Ask students to write it on their mini-whiteboards. Repeat for Philadelphia (around 40,000). This provides a shared data point.
    4.  **Independent Practice / Activity (30 min):** In pairs, students use their maps to locate and label the six cities in their notebooks (the Erie Canal can be drawn in). Then, using the provided websites, they research the approximate founding-era and current populations for each city. They must write these numbers down in standard form in a chart in their notebooks.
        *   **Differentiation (Support):** Provide a pre-made chart with the city names and the population numbers already filled in. The students' task is to practice reading the numbers aloud to a partner and locating the cities on the map.
        *   **Differentiation (Enrichment):** Students can also research the population of their own town, both now and at its founding, and add it to their chart.
    5.  **Exit Ticket (5 min):** Write a 6-digit number on the board (e.g., 345,987). Students must write it down on a slip of paper and circle the digit in the ten-thousands place.

### **Day 4: A Nation by the Numbers**

*   **Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to write multi-digit numbers in expanded form and use <, >, and = to compare the populations of major U.S. cities.
*   **Primary Standard(s) Addressed:** `4.NR.1.1` (Read and write... expanded form), `4.NR.1.3` (Use place value reasoning to... compare).
*   **Materials:**
    *   Students' Storytellers' Notebooks with the population data from Day 3
    *   Place value anchor chart
    *   Mini-whiteboards and markers
    *   "Comparing Numbers" anchor chart showing how to use <, >, =

*   **Lesson Plan:**
    1.  **Warm-Up / Spiral Review (10 min):** Multiplication fact practice using flashcards or a digital tool (e.g., Blooket, Kahoot). This keeps automaticity sharp for future problem-solving.
    2.  **Direct Instruction (15 min):** Review reading multi-digit numbers. Then, introduce expanded form. Using Boston's population (16,000), model how to break it down: 10,000 + 6,000. Use a larger number, like Philadelphia's current population, to model a more complex example. Next, introduce comparing numbers. Model how to line up two numbers (e.g., Boston's 16,000 and NYC's 23,000) and compare them place by place, starting from the left. Model writing the comparison sentence: 16,000 < 23,000.
    3.  **Guided Practice (20 min):** Give the class two population numbers from their charts. Ask them to write both in expanded form on their whiteboards. Check for understanding. Then, ask them to write a comparison statement using <, >, or =. Do several examples together, having students share their reasoning ("I knew it was greater because the digit in the ten-thousands place was bigger.").
    4.  **Independent Practice / Activity (30 min):** In their notebooks, under their data chart from yesterday, students complete two tasks:
        1.  Choose three cities and write their founding-era populations in expanded form.
        2.  Write five comparison statements about the cities' populations. At least two must compare founding-era data, and two must compare current data. One can compare a founding-era number to a current one.
        *   **Differentiation (Support):** Provide a template with the city names and comparison symbols already written, e.g., "(City Name) ____ < ____ (City Name)". Students fill in the correct numbers. Use smaller, 4-digit numbers for practice first.
        *   **Differentiation (Enrichment):** Challenge students to order all six cities from least to greatest population for both the founding era and the current era, creating two "Top 6" lists.
    5.  **Exit Ticket (5 min):** On an index card, students complete this sentence: "Write a number that is greater than 115,240 but less than 115,300."

### **Day 5: The Classroom Ecosystem & Community Circle**

*   **Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to describe the roles of producer, consumer, and decomposer using the classroom community as a model.
*   **Primary Standard(s) Addressed:** `S4L1.a` (Develop a model to describe the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers), `4.P.EICC.1.e` (Participate in a community of readers and writers).
*   **Materials:**
    *   Anchor chart paper titled "Our Classroom Ecosystem"
    *   Markers
    *   Storytellers' Notebooks
    *   A designated "Author's Chair"

*   **Lesson Plan:**
    1.  **Warm-Up / Spiral Review (10 min):** "Noun, Verb, or Adjective?" Write 5-7 sentences on the board related to our week's work (e.g., "The wide Mississippi River flows south."). Students identify one noun, one verb, and one adjective from the sentences.
    2.  **Direct Instruction (15 min):** Introduce the term "ecosystem." Define producer (makes its own food/energy - like plants), consumer (eats other things for energy), and decomposer (breaks down dead things and returns nutrients to the soil - like fungi). Then, propose a metaphor: "What if our classroom is an ecosystem?"
    3.  **Guided Practice (20 min):** As a whole class, create the "Our Classroom Ecosystem" anchor chart. Ask students: "In our classroom, who *produces* the knowledge or the materials for a lesson?" (The teacher, a book, a video). "Who *consumes* or takes in that knowledge?" (The students!). "This is the most interesting one: Who are the *decomposers*? Who helps break down confusing ideas so we can all understand them?" (Students who ask good questions, students who help a partner, the teacher when re-explaining). Draw simple icons and label these roles on the chart.
    4.  **Independent Practice / Activity (30 min):**
        *   **Part 1 (Science Model - 15 min):** In their notebooks, students draw a simple model of a *natural* ecosystem (e.g., a forest). They must draw and label at least one producer (a tree), one consumer (a deer), and one decomposer (a mushroom).
        *   **Part 2 (Author's Chair - 15 min):** Introduce the "Author's Chair" routine. Explain that this is a safe, special time to share our writing from our notebooks. Ask for 3-4 volunteers to share something they wrote this week (a goal, a reflection, their cursive quote). The audience's job is to listen respectfully and then offer one piece of positive feedback ("I liked how you..." or "It was interesting when you wrote...").
        *   **Differentiation (Support):** Provide students with pre-drawn templates of a forest scene where they only need to label the roles. For Author's Chair, a student can ask the teacher to read their entry for them if they are shy.
        *   **Differentiation (Enrichment):** Students can draw a more complex ecosystem (ocean, desert) and label multiple examples of each role.
    5.  **Exit Ticket (5 min):** Students write their name on a sticky note and label themselves as a producer, consumer, or decomposer based on their role in today's lesson, with a one-sentence explanation. (e.g., "I was a consumer because I learned about ecosystems.").
