### Yearly Project Arc

**Quarter 1 (Fall)**
*   **Project Bundle:** Bundle 2: Narratives of a Nation
*   **Rationale:** This bundle is placed first because it establishes the most foundational skills for the year in both math (place value, all four operations with whole numbers) and ELA (establishing a reader/writer identity, basic narrative structure). The social studies content on the American Revolution provides a strong chronological starting point for the year's historical narrative.

**Quarter 2 (Late Fall/Winter)**
*   **Project Bundle:** Bundle 1: Structures of Power & Persuasion
*   **Rationale:** Following the foundational arithmetic of Q1, this bundle introduces key prerequisite concepts like factors, multiples, and geometry, which will be needed for later fraction work. The ELA focus shifts from storytelling to analyzing persuasive structures and author's purpose, a logical step up in analytical thinking.

**Quarter 3 (Winter/Spring)**
*   **Project Bundle:** Bundle 3: Forces of Change
*   **Rationale:** This bundle tackles the most complex new mathematical concepts of the year—fractions and decimals—which rely heavily on the whole number and factor skills from the first two quarters. The project's ELA and Social Studies focus on research, collaboration, and the immense societal changes of the Civil War era provides a rigorous, content-rich context for these challenging skills.

**Quarter 4 (Spring)**
*   **Project Bundle:** Bundle 4: Cosmos & Community
*   **Rationale:** This bundle serves as a capstone, focusing on the application and synthesis of previously learned skills, as indicated by the inclusion of only math practice standards. The ELA standards are culminating in nature, covering the full writing process, author's craft, and presentation skills, while the science theme of Earth & Space is ideal for spring observations.
