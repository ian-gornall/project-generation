### **1. Overall Project Concept**

*   **Project Title:** Journey Across a New Nation
*   **Essential Question:** How do the journeys of individuals and the dynamics of the environment shape a nation’s story?
*   **Final Project "Performance Task":** Students will create a multi-entry historical traveler’s journal from the perspective of a person living during the American Revolution or Westward Expansion, incorporating narrative writing, cursive, maps, and mathematical calculations about their journey.

### **2. Unit Phases & Instructional Sequence**

This 8-week unit is broken into three phases, moving from foundational knowledge to integrated application.

#### **Phase 1: Building the World (Weeks 1-3)**

*   **Phase Goal:** Students will build foundational knowledge of the key historical context, scientific concepts of ecosystems, and mathematical skills with large numbers that are necessary for understanding the era.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**
    1.  **Activity (Learning the Skill): Social Studies Jigsaw & Mapping.** Students work in expert groups to read about and become specialists on the causes of the American Revolution (e.g., Stamp Act, Boston Massacre). They then teach their home groups. The class collectively maps the 13 colonies and key cities like Boston and Philadelphia. (`SS4H1.a`, `SS4G1.b`)
    2.  **Activity (Learning the Skill): Math Place Value Bootcamp.** Through direct instruction, number talks, and games, students learn to read, write, compare, and round multi-digit whole numbers. Real-world data is used, such as the populations of colonial cities in 1775 or the cost of goods. (`4.NR.1.1`, `4.NR.1.3`, `4.NR.1.4`)
    3.  **Activity (Learning the Skill): Ecosystem Explorers.** Students receive direct instruction on the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers. In small groups, they apply this by creating a simple food chain model for a common North American ecosystem of the 18th century (e.g., the Eastern Woodlands). (`S4L1.a`, `S4L1.b`)
    4.  **Activity (Learning the Skill): ELA Foundations Workshop.** The teacher provides daily mini-lessons and practice on foundational ELA skills. This includes daily cursive practice, direct instruction on grammar (helping/linking verbs, plural possessives), and reading short, high-interest historical texts to identify context and perspective. (`4.F.H.4.a`, `4.L.GC.1.33`, `4.L.GC.1.37`, `4.T.C.2.c`)
    5.  **Activity (Applying the Skill): "Who Am I?" Character Brainstorm.** After learning about the era, students begin brainstorming a potential character for their final journal (e.g., a Daughter of Liberty in Boston, a soldier in the Continental Army, a pioneer on the Oregon Trail). They create a simple character profile, making their first choices as writers. (`4.P.EICC.1.b`, `4.P.EICC.2.a`)

#### **Phase 2: Conflict, Change, and Calculation (Weeks 4-6)**

*   **Phase Goal:** Students will analyze the conflicts and changes that defined the era, learn to perform all four mathematical operations with multi-digit numbers, and practice structuring a compelling narrative.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**
    1.  **Activity (Learning the Skill): Math Operations Task Cards.** Through stations and direct instruction, students learn and practice strategies for multi-digit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. (`4.NR.2.1`, `4.NR.2.3`, `4.NR.2.4`)
    2.  **Activity (Applying the Skill): "Revolutionary & Westward Math."** Students solve multi-step word problems grounded in historical context. For example: "The Louisiana Purchase was about 828,000 square miles and cost $15,000,000. If it were divided equally among 3 commissioners, how much land would each be responsible for?" (Teacher can simplify numbers as needed). This connects math directly to the Social Studies content. (`4.MP.1`, `4.MP.4`, `4.NR.2.5`)
    3.  **Activity (Learning & Applying): Narrative Structure & Dialogue.** The teacher provides direct instruction on narrative techniques (problem, events, resolution) and the mechanics of writing dialogue (quotation marks, commas, direct address). Students then apply this by writing a single, powerful scene from their character's perspective, such as reacting to the Declaration of Independence or seeing the Rocky Mountains for the first time. (`4.T.T.1.e`, `4.L.GC.1.30`, `4.L.GC.1.36`)
    4.  **Activity (Applying the Skill): "An Ecosystem in Crisis" Scenario.** Students analyze the effects of a change on an ecosystem (e.g., the near-extinction of the buffalo due to westward expansion). They create a "before and after" food web model and write a paragraph explaining how the flow of energy was disrupted. This parallels the social disruptions they are learning about. (`S4L1.c`, `S4L1.d`)
    5.  **Activity (Learning the Skill): Cursive Correspondence.** Students practice reading and writing cursive by transcribing (or responding to) short, teacher-created "letters" written in cursive that contain historical details. This builds fluency and reinforces content. (`4.F.H.3.a`, `4.F.H.4.b`)

#### **Phase 3: Creating the Narrative (Weeks 7-8)**

*   **Phase Goal:** Students will synthesize their learning from all content areas to independently produce their final project, the Historical Traveler's Journal.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**
    1.  **Activity (Applying the Skill): The Traveler's Journal Workshop.** This is the main event. Students draft, revise, and edit the entries for their journals. The teacher acts as a facilitator, conducting small-group and individual writing conferences. Peer feedback sessions are structured to focus on narrative clarity and use of descriptive detail. (`4.P.EICC.1.e`, `4.T.T.1.e`, `4.T.C.1.c`)
    2.  **Activity (Applying the Skill): Journey by the Numbers.** Students are required to create and embed at least three mathematical story problems within their journal. For example, a Lewis and Clark expedition member might calculate the total distance traveled over 4 weeks, or a gold miner might calculate potential earnings vs. the cost of supplies. They must show their work clearly on a separate page in the journal. (`4.MP.4`, `4.NR.2.5`, `4.MDR.6.1`)
    3.  **Activity (Applying the Skill): Illustrating the Journey.** Students integrate multimodal elements into their journals. This includes drawing and labeling a map of their character's journey (`SS4G1`, `SS4G2.b`), illustrating a scene, and creating a diagram of a food web from a region they "traveled" through. (`S4L1.b`)
    4.  **Activity (Applying the Skill): Final Cursive Publication.** Students select at least two of their journal entries to write in their best, most legible cursive, paying close attention to letter formation, connectors, and spacing. This serves as the polished, final presentation of this skill. (`4.F.H.4.a`, `4.F.H.4.b`)
    5.  **Activity (Showcasing Learning): "Narratives of a Nation" Gallery Walk.** Students display their completed journals. The class participates in a gallery walk, leaving positive and specific feedback for their peers on sticky notes. This serves as the unit's culminating celebration and provides students with an authentic audience. (`4.P.EICC.1.e`, `4.P.EICC.2.a`)
