### **1. Overall Project Concept**

*   **Project Title:** Monuments to Freedom: Building Our Rights
*   **Essential Question:** How do rules and tools help us build a better and more just world?
*   **Final Project "Performance Task":** Students will design and construct a model of a monument dedicated to a specific right from the Bill of Rights, then write and present a persuasive proposal arguing for their monument's construction to a "Constitutional Committee" (their classmates and teacher).

### **2. Unit Phases & Instructional Sequence**

This 9-week unit is divided into three distinct phases, moving from foundational knowledge to synthesis and finally to creative application.

#### **Phase 1: The Building Blocks of Structure & Force (Weeks 1-3)**

*   **Phase Goal:** To build foundational, discrete skills in physical science, geometry, and government. Students will understand the component parts of both physical and political systems before they are asked to connect them.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**
    1.  **Learning the Skill (Science): Simple Machine Labs.** Students participate in hands-on learning stations to investigate the six simple machines. They will pull weights with pulleys, lift objects with levers, and roll carts up inclined planes to observe how forces can be changed. (`S4P3.c`)
    2.  **Learning the Skill (Math): Geometry Boot Camp.** Through direct instruction and practice, students will learn to identify, draw, and measure angles (acute, obtuse, right) using protractors. They will identify points, lines, rays, and parallel/perpendicular lines in 2D shapes and their environment. (`4.GSR.7.1`, `4.GSR.7.2`, `4.GSR.8.1`)
    3.  **Learning the Skill (Social Studies): The Constitutional Crisis.** Students will read grade-level texts and analyze simplified primary source excerpts to understand the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation and the key problems (state vs. federal power, representation) facing the framers. (`SS4H2.a`, `SS4H2.b`)
    4.  **Learning the Skill (ELA): The Language of Detail.** Direct instruction mini-lessons will focus on foundational grammar for clear explanations. Students will practice forming prepositional phrases to describe where and how things happen and ensuring pronoun-antecedent agreement in their sentences. (`4.L.GC.1.27`, `4.L.GC.1.29`)
    5.  **Applying the Skill (Integrated): "Machine Investigators" Report.** Students will choose an object in the school (e.g., flagpole, door, ramp) and write a short, one-paragraph report identifying the simple machines and geometric angles they observe, using at least three prepositional phrases in their description. This is a low-stakes application of the week's learning.

#### **Phase 2: Assembling the Systems of Power (Weeks 4-6)**

*   **Phase Goal:** To connect the concepts of physical structures with political structures. Students will analyze how systems (both mechanical and governmental) are designed with purpose and how to build arguments.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**
    1.  **Learning the Skill (Social Studies/ELA): The "Machinery" of Government.** Using graphic organizers, students will learn about the three branches of government, separation of powers, and checks and balances. They will analyze how this structure creates a balanced system, much like balanced forces in science. (`SS4CG3.a`)
    2.  **Learning the Skill (Math): Prime & Composite Structures.** Students will learn to find factor pairs for numbers up to 100, identifying numbers as prime (only 1 and itself as factors) or composite (multiple factors). This will be framed as finding the "building blocks" of numbers, creating a conceptual link to simple machines as the building blocks of complex ones. (`4.PAR.3.3`, `4.PAR.3.4`)
    3.  **Learning the Skill (ELA): Building a Strong Argument.** Through direct instruction, students will learn the structure of an opinion piece: state a claim, provide reasons, and support reasons with evidence. They will learn to use linking words (`because`, `therefore`) and relative pronouns/adverbs (`who`, `which`, `where`) to connect their ideas. (`4.T.T.3.a`, `4.L.GC.1.31`)
    4.  **Applying the Skill (Integrated): Checks & Balances Debate.** Students will participate in a structured academic controversy, taking on the role of a branch of government and arguing for a specific (teacher-provided) action. They must use evidence from their learning about checks and balances to support their claims and critique the reasoning of other "branches." (`4.MP.3`, `SS4CG3.a`, `4.T.T.3.c`)
    5.  **Applying the Skill (Integrated): Bill of Rights Poetry.** To deeply understand the freedoms guaranteed by the government's structure, each student will select one right from the Bill of Rights and write a short poem (e.g., free verse or simple rhyme scheme) that captures its meaning and importance. (`SS4CG3.b`, `4.T.T.4.b`)

#### **Phase 3: Monuments to Freedom - Design, Build, Persuade (Weeks 7-9)**

*   **Phase Goal:** To apply all consolidated knowledge and skills in the culminating project. This phase shifts from teacher-led instruction to student-centered creation, with the teacher acting as a facilitator and coach.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**
    1.  **Project Launch & Research:** The teacher formally introduces the "Monuments to Freedom" project. Students select a right from the Bill of Rights to focus on. They conduct brief, focused research on why that right was included in the Constitution. (`SS4CG3.b`, `4.P.ST.1.a`)
    2.  **Design & Blueprint:** Students create a detailed, labeled blueprint of their monument. They must incorporate at least three geometric concepts (e.g., parallel lines, specific angle types) and at least one simple machine that *symbolizes* the function of their chosen right. They will calculate the area and perimeter of any rectangular parts of their design. (`4.GSR.8.1`, `4.GSR.8.3`, `S4P3.c`)
    3.  **Construct & Propose:** Students use craft materials (or a digital tool like Tinkercad) to build a 3D model from their blueprint. Simultaneously, they draft their persuasive proposal. This formal text must: introduce the right (expository), state their opinion on why their monument is the best representation (opinion), and use complex sentences, correct capitalization for titles, and commas after introductory clauses. (`4.T.T.2.d`, `4.T.T.3.c`, `4.L.GC.2.b`, `4.L.GC.1.40`, `4.L.GC.1.41`)
    4.  **Peer Critique & Revision:** Students engage in a "gallery walk" of blueprints and proposal drafts. Using a structured protocol, they offer feedback on the clarity of the design and the strength of the argument, practicing the skill of critiquing the reasoning of others. (`4.MP.3`)
    5.  **The Constitutional Convention (Final Presentations):** Students present their finished monument and persuasive proposal to the class. They must clearly explain the symbolism, defend their design choices, and persuade the audience of their monument's value. The audience, in turn, asks clarifying questions. (`S4P3.b` - arguing to support a claim, `4.P.ST.2.c` - considering audience).
