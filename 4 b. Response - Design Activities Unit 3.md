### **1. Overall Project Concept**

*   **Project Title:** Echoes of Freedom: A Museum of Change
*   **Essential Question:** How do powerful forces—both in society and in nature—create lasting change?
*   **Final Project "Performance Task":** Students will collaborate in research teams to create a multi-media museum exhibit that teaches peers and families about a significant "force of change" from the American Civil War and Reconstruction era.

### **2. Detailed Phases & Activities**

#### **Phase 1: Sparking the Inquiry: What Causes Change?**

This phase launches the project by introducing the core concepts of change through parallel explorations in social studies and science. Students will begin collaborating, generating questions, and building foundational skills.

*   **Key Activities & Lessons:**
    1.  **Activity: "Voices for Change" Gallery Walk.** Set up stations around the room with images, short biographies, and a powerful quote from each key figure of the abolitionist and suffrage movements (Douglass, Tubman, Stanton, Truth). In small groups, students rotate through the stations, recording observations and generating "I wonder..." questions on sticky notes. This launches the inquiry process.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `SS4H4.a`, `4.T.RA.1.a`

    2.  **Activity: "States of Change" Science Lab.** Students conduct a hands-on investigation to observe water changing states. They will melt ice cubes (solid to liquid) and, with teacher supervision, observe water boiling and creating steam (liquid to gas), and condensation forming on a cool surface (gas to liquid). We will use the analogy of "pressure building up" in both the water and in the nation before the Civil War.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `S4E3.a`

    3.  **Activity: Museum Team Charters.** Students are placed into their "Museum Design Teams." Their first task is to create a team charter. They will collaboratively establish group norms for discussion, define roles (e.g., Lead Researcher, Materials Manager, Lead Designer), and set initial goals for their future exhibit, practicing effective collaboration from day one.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.P.CP.1.a`, `4.P.CP.1.b`, `4.P.CP.1.c`

    4.  **Activity: "Fair Share" Fraction Bar Challenge.** To build foundational fraction skills, students use physical and digital fraction bars to explore equivalence. They work in pairs to find as many ways as possible to represent 1/2, 1/4, etc. This hands-on work builds a concrete understanding needed for comparing fractions with different denominators later. We will frame this around the concept of "fairness" and "equal parts," linking thematically to the social studies content.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.NR.4.1`, `4.NR.4.2`

#### **Phase 2: The Investigation: Conflict & Communication**

In this phase, student teams dive deep into their chosen topics. They conduct research, analyze information, and learn new skills in math, science, and ELA that will be necessary for building their final exhibit.

*   **Key Activities & Lessons:**
    1.  **Activity: Civil War Research Dossiers.** Each Museum Team selects a specific research topic (e.g., The Battle of Gettysburg, The Role of Abraham Lincoln, Sherman's March to the Sea). They use a structured digital or paper "Dossier" to guide their research, locating and gathering key facts from multiple pre-vetted print and digital sources, and practicing how to quote and cite evidence accurately.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `SS4H5.c, SS4H5.d`, `4.T.RA.1.b`, `4.T.RA.2.a`

    2.  **Activity: "Shedding Light on the Truth" Lab.** Students conduct an investigation into how light interacts with different materials. They use flashlights to test various objects and classify them as transparent, translucent, or opaque. The lesson concludes with a discussion: How is finding a credible, truthful source like shining a light through a transparent object? How can some sources be "opaque" and hide the truth?
        *   **Primary Standards:** `S4P1.a`, `S4T.RA.2.b`

    3.  **Activity: Civil War Math Scenarios.** We move from concrete fractions to abstract problem-solving. Students work through a series of word problems grounded in the historical context. For example: "In one regiment, 3/10 of the soldiers were from Maine and 4/100 were from New Hampshire. What fraction of the regiment were from these two states combined? Write your answer as a fraction and a decimal."
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.NR.4.6`, `4.NR.5.1`, `4.NR.5.2`

    4.  **Activity: "Connecting the Past" Writing Workshop.** Students analyze excerpts from historical texts and their own research notes. A mini-lesson focuses on using transition words (`similarly`, `in contrast`, `as a result`) and comparative/superlative adjectives (`braver`, `most effective`) to write sentences and short paragraphs comparing leaders, contrasting strategies, or showing cause and effect.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.T.SS.1.c`, `4.L.GC.1.28`

#### **Phase 3: Synthesis & Showcase: Building the Museum**

This is the creation phase where all the learning comes together. Students synthesize their research, apply their science and math skills, and construct their final museum exhibits for an authentic audience.

*   **Key Activities & Lessons:**
    1.  **Activity: Exhibit Construction Workshop.** Students work in their teams to build their museum exhibits. This involves multiple components: writing clear, concise informational text panels; selecting powerful images and maps; creating visual aids; and designing the overall layout to be engaging for a visitor. This is a sustained period of application and collaboration.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.T.RA.1.c`, `4.T.SS.1.b`, `SS4H6` (content)

    2.  **Activity: The "Freedom Telegraph" Challenge.** Each team must design and build a device that can communicate a simple message (like a key word from their exhibit, e.g., "VOTE" or "UNION") across the classroom using either light or sound. They can build string telephones, light-based Morse code flashers, or percussion instruments. This device becomes an interactive part of their museum exhibit.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `S4P2.b`

    3.  **Activity: "Data Stories of Reconstruction."** Teams are given a relevant data set (e.g., number of schools established by the Freedmen's Bureau per year; comparison of cotton production under sharecropping vs. slavery). They must create a dot plot to visually represent this data and write a caption for their exhibit that answers the question: "What story does this data tell us about the effects of the war and Reconstruction?"
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.MDR.6.3`, `4.MDR.6.2`, `SS4H5.e`, `SS4H6.b`

    4.  **Activity: The "Echoes of Freedom" Museum Opening.** The final performance task. We transform the classroom or library into a museum. Students stand with their exhibits and act as docents, presenting their research to an authentic audience of other classes, school staff, and families. They explain their topic, share their data story, and demonstrate their light/sound communication device.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.P.CP.1.d`, `4.T.SS.1` (culmination), `S4P2` (application)
