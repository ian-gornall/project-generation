ROLE:
You are a master curriculum planner with expertise in thematic unit design.

TASK:
I have provided a master list of 4th-grade student academic standards below. Your task is to partition this entire list into 4-5 logical, cross-curricular "Project Bundles." Each bundle should contain a mix of standards from multiple subjects (Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies) that could logically be taught together in a single, thematic project.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST use every single standard from the master list exactly once across all bundles.
- Do NOT alter, rewrite, or blend the standards. Copy them verbatim.
- Name each bundle with a simple, thematic title (e.g., "Bundle 1: Structures & Forces," "Bundle 2: Narratives & History").

CONTEXT: THE MASTER STANDARDS LIST

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Produce a list of the partitioned bundles. Use this format precisely:

### Project Bundle 1: [Thematic Title]
- **Mathematics**
  - `[Code]`: [Verbatim Description]
  - `[Code]`: [Verbatim Description]
- **English Language Arts**
  - `[Code]`: [Verbatim Description]
- **Science**
  - `[Code]`: [Verbatim Description]

### Project Bundle 2: [Thematic Title]
- **Mathematics**
  - `[Code]`: [Verbatim Description]
- ... (and so on for all 4-5 bundles, until every standard is used)
