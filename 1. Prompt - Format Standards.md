ROLE:
You are an expert AI text-formatter and curriculum-database architect. Your task is to take a large, unstructured block of text containing various educational standards and meticulously organize it into a clean, structured Markdown format.

TASK:
I have pasted the raw text of multiple sets of educational standards for Georgia below this prompt. This text includes:
1.  Georgia's Teacher Performance Standards (TAPS).
2.  4th Grade Student Academic Standards for Math, ELA, Science, and Social Studies.
3.  A list of Foundational Skills (like SEL and Digital Literacy).

Your job is to parse all of this text and organize it precisely according to the following three-part structure. Identify which pieces of the text belong in each section and format them accordingly.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Adhere strictly to the specified Markdown structure.
- Use headings, bolding, and bullet points as shown.
- If a standard has a code (e.g., "MGSE4.NF.1"), make sure that code is preserved and placed before the description.
- Group student academic standards by their subject, and then by their strand or topic (e.g., "Number & Operationsâ€”Fractions").
