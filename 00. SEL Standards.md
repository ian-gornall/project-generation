Excellent. This is a powerful and necessary step. By integrating the motivational science from "10 to 25" into the established, evidence-based structure of existing SEL standards (like the CASEL 5 framework used in Ohio and many other states), we create a more robust, effective, and authentic approach.

This framework doesn't replace the "what" (the five competencies) but provides the "how" and "why" — a research-backed engine for implementation that fosters genuine, intrinsic development rather than mere compliance.

### **An Integrated Framework: Fusing SEL Competencies with Motivational Science**

**Core Principle:** The development of the five core SEL competencies is not a checklist of skills to be taught, but a natural outcome of an environment where a young person's fundamental psychological needs are met. The principles from "10 to 25" provide the pedagogical and relational lens through which we teach, model, and cultivate these competencies.

**The "10 to 25" Motivational Lens:** This approach is grounded in Self-Determination Theory and the work of Dr. Brad Reedy. It posits that all behavior is a communication of a need. Intrinsic motivation and emotional regulation flourish when three core needs are met:

1.  **Relatedness (Connection):** The need to feel seen, heard, valued, and securely attached to others. **Connection is the prerequisite for influence.**
2.  **Autonomy (Agency):** The need to have a voice, make choices, and feel a sense of ownership over one's life.
3.  **Competence (Mastery):** The need to feel effective, capable, and able to build skills through effort.

We will now apply this motivational lens to enhance the standard five SEL competencies, providing a developmental continuum with integrated strategies.

### **Continuum of Development Across the Five SEL Competencies**
**(Enhanced by the "10 to 25" Motivational Lens)**

#### **Competency 1: Self-Awareness**
*   **Standard Definition:** The ability to understand one’s own emotions, thoughts, and values and how they influence behavior.
*   **"10 to 25" Motivational Lens:** Self-awareness is deepened by moving beyond merely *labeling* emotions to *connecting them to underlying needs*. Instead of "I feel angry," the goal is "I feel angry because my need for autonomy is not being met." This reframes emotion as a signal, not a problem.

| Developmental Stage | Standard Benchmark (The "What") | Integrated Motivational Strategy (The "How" & "Why") |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Early Elementary (K-3)** | Identifies and names basic emotions. Recognizes personal likes and dislikes. | **Strategy: Connect Feelings to Needs.** Adult asks, "You look sad. Is it because you miss your mom (need for connection)? Or because you wanted to choose the blue crayon (need for autonomy)?" |
| **Late Elementary / Middle (4-8)** | Describes how their emotions connect to their behavior. Identifies personal strengths and areas for growth. | **Strategy: Introduce Needs-Based Language.** Teach the concepts of autonomy, competence, and connection. "When you got frustrated and crumpled your paper, was it because you were worried you couldn't do it (competence)?" |
| **High School / Young Adult (9-12+)** | Analyzes how their values, identity, and emotions influence their choices. Recognizes their inherent self-worth. | **Strategy: Differentiate Worth from Performance.** Facilitate discussions on toxic shame ("I am bad") vs. healthy guilt ("I did something bad"). Explore how the pursuit of external validation (grades, likes) can disconnect them from their true needs and values. |

#### **Competency 2: Self-Management**
*   **Standard Definition:** The ability to manage one’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors effectively in different situations.
*   **"10 to 25" Motivational Lens:** Self-management shifts from a model of *behavioral control* (using rewards/punishments) to a model of *distress tolerance*. The goal is not to suppress emotion, but to feel it and still make a value-aligned choice. This is achieved through co-regulation and by allowing natural consequences to be the teacher.

| Developmental Stage | Standard Benchmark (The "What") | Integrated Motivational Strategy (The "How" & "Why") |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Early Elementary (K-3)** | Uses simple coping skills (e.g., deep breaths). Follows classroom routines with reminders. | **Strategy: Co-regulation and Safe Spaces.** When a child is dysregulated, the adult provides a calm, connected presence. "I'm right here with you. It's okay to be angry. Let's breathe together." The calm-down corner is a place to feel, not a punishment. |
| **Late Elementary / Middle (4-8)** | Manages stress and controls impulses. Sets and works toward short-term goals. | **Strategy: Emphasize Natural Consequences.** Instead of imposing a punishment for a forgotten assignment, facilitate a conversation about the natural result: "What was it like in class today when you didn't have your work? How did that feel?" This builds competence and autonomy. |
| **High School / Young Adult (9-12+)** | Develops and uses advanced stress management strategies. Pursues long-term goals with perseverance. | **Strategy: Teach Distress Tolerance.** Acknowledge and validate the discomfort of difficult tasks. "It's normal to feel overwhelmed. The goal isn't to make the feeling go away, but to do the next right thing *even while you feel it*." This builds resilience far more than lectures or nagging. |

#### **Competency 3: Social Awareness**
*   **Standard Definition:** The ability to take the perspective of and empathize with others from diverse backgrounds.
*   **"10 to 25" Motivational Lens:** This moves empathy to the deeper level of **validation**. It means communicating, "Your feelings make sense from your perspective." It also involves teaching students to look for the unmet needs behind *other people's* behaviors.

| Developmental Stage | Standard Benchmark (The "What") | Integrated Motivational Strategy (The "How" & "Why") |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Early Elementary (K-3)** | Recognizes that others have different feelings. Shows care and concern for others. | **Strategy: Wonder About Others' Needs.** "He snatched the toy. I wonder if he was feeling lonely and didn't know how to ask to play (need for connection)?" |
| **Late Elementary / Middle (4-8)** | Accurately describes the perspective of a peer or family member. Recognizes social and group norms. | **Strategy: Empathy Before Advice.** In peer conflicts, the first step is for each student to articulate the other's feelings and needs *to that person's satisfaction*. "So, you're saying you felt hurt because you needed to be included?" |
| **High School / Young Adult (9-12+)** | Analyzes how social and historical factors impact people's perspectives. Understands and challenges stereotypes and prejudice. | **Strategy: Find the Universal Need.** When analyzing complex social conflicts, guide students to identify the valid, universal human needs (e.g., for safety, belonging, dignity) driving all sides, even when they disagree with the behaviors. |

#### **Competency 4: Relationship Skills**
*   **Standard Definition:** The ability to establish and maintain healthy and supportive relationships.
*   **"10 to 25" Motivational Lens:** The foundational principle is **Connection before Correction**. Healthy relationships are built on authenticity, vulnerability, and trust, not on one person trying to control or "fix" another. Conflict is viewed as a rupture in connection that needs to be repaired.

| Developmental Stage | Standard Benchmark (The "What") | Integrated Motivational Strategy (The "How" & "Why") |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Early Elementary (K-3)** | Plays cooperatively. Uses listening skills. Asks for help when needed. | **Strategy: Model Relational Repair.** An adult models authentic apologies: "I'm sorry I raised my voice. I was feeling frustrated. Can we try again?" This shows that relationships can survive mistakes. |
| **Late Elementary / Middle (4-8)** | Communicates effectively. Navigates peer conflict. Resists negative social pressure. | **Strategy: Teach Boundaries as an Act of Self-Respect.** Frame setting boundaries not as rejecting someone, but as honoring one's own needs, which is essential for any healthy relationship. Practice "I-statements" that focus on personal feelings and needs. |
| **High School / Young Adult (9-12+)** | Builds and maintains trusting relationships with diverse individuals. Navigates complex social situations. | **Strategy: Foster Authentic Vulnerability.** Discuss the difference between fitting in (changing yourself to be accepted) and belonging (being accepted for who you are). Create a classroom culture where it is safe to share struggles and be supported without judgment. |

#### **Competency 5: Responsible Decision-Making**
*   **Standard Definition:** The ability to make caring and constructive choices about personal behavior and social interactions.
*   **"10 to 25" Motivational Lens:** Responsible decision-making is rooted in an **internal locus of control**. A good decision is one that aligns with one's authentic values and needs. The focus is on learning from the *experience* of a choice, facilitated by natural consequences, rather than on compliance with external rules to avoid punishment.

| Developmental Stage | Standard Benchmark (The "What") | Integrated Motivational Strategy (The "How" & "Why") |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Early Elementary (K-3)** | Identifies the consequences of simple actions. Makes choices in play and learning. | **Strategy: Allow Small, Safe Failures.** "You chose not to wear your jacket to recess. What did you notice about your body when you were outside?" This connects choice directly to felt experience, building competence and autonomy. |
| **Late Elementary / Middle (4-8)** | Considers the well-being of self and others when making decisions. Solves problems collaboratively. | **Strategy: Shift from "Why Did You Do That?" to "What Will You Do Now?"** When a poor choice is made, the focus is not on lectures but on problem-solving and restitution. "Okay, that happened. What is your plan to repair the harm and learn from this?" |
| **High School / Young Adult (9-12+)** | Analyzes how their decisions impact their goals, relationships, and well-being. Makes choices aligned with personal ethics and values. | **Strategy: Facilitate Value-Based Decision-Making.** Have students articulate their top 3-5 core values (e.g., integrity, connection, growth). When facing a dilemma, they can ask: "Which choice moves me closer to being the person I want to be, based on my values?" |


Here is a list of Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) standards for fourth grade, formatted in a conventional style.

These standards are built on the five core competencies of SEL and are enhanced by the research-backed motivational principles from "10 to 25," focusing on building intrinsic motivation through connection, autonomy, and competence.

---

### **Fourth Grade Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Standards**
