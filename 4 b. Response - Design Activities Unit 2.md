### **1. Overall Project Concept**

*   **Project Title:** The Freedom Monument
*   **Essential Question:** How can we use physical and written structures to powerfully represent the ideas we believe in?
*   **Final Project "Performance Task":** Student teams will design a monument representing a right from the Bill of Rights, build a physical model of it, and write a persuasive proposal to convince a panel of community leaders (e.g., the principal, other teachers, parent volunteers) to "fund" its construction.

### **2. Detailed Phases & Activities**

#### **Phase 1: Building Blocks of Structure & Power**

This foundational phase introduces students to the core components they will need: the basic elements of geometry, force, government, and persuasive language. We will explore how simple elements combine to create something more complex.

*   **Key Activities & Lessons:**
    1.  **Rights & Ideas Gallery Walk:** Students explore stations with excerpts from the Declaration of Independence and the Preamble. They use sticky notes to write down what phrases like "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" and "We the People" mean to them. This sets the context for why governments are structured the way they are.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `SS4CG1.a`, `SS4CG1.b`, `4.P.ST.1`

    2.  **Geometric "Blueprint" Basics:** Students become "architects-in-training." They learn to draw and identify points, lines, rays, and angles. They then complete a "Blueprint Scavenger Hunt" in the school, finding and sketching examples of parallel lines, perpendicular lines, and right, acute, and obtuse angles in the building's structure.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.GSR.8.1`, `4.GSR.7.1`

    3.  **Force & Motion Lab:** In small groups, students conduct investigations using toy cars, ramps, and strings to see the effects of pushes and pulls. They document their experiments, distinguishing between situations with balanced forces (the car is still) and unbalanced forces (the car moves/speeds up/slows down).
        *   **Primary Standard:** `S4P3.a`

    4.  **Prime & Composite "Building Blocks":** We frame prime numbers as the "indivisible building blocks" of all other numbers. Students use arrays and factor-finding activities (e.g., creating rectangles with tiles for the number 12 vs. the number 7) to discover the difference between prime and composite numbers.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.PAR.3.3`, `4.PAR.3.4`

    5.  **Poetry of Power:** Students read and discuss different forms of poetry (haiku, limerick, free verse). They analyze how the *structure* of a poem (its rhythm, rhyme, or lack thereof) can make its message more powerful or persuasive, connecting to the unit's theme. They practice writing their own short poems about a simple concept, like "force" or "fairness."
        *   **Primary Standard:** `4.T.T.4.a`

#### **Phase 2: Analyzing Systems of Force & Government**

In this phase, students move from individual components to analyzing how those components work together in a systemâ€”be it a government, a logical argument, or a geometric shape.

*   **Key Activities & Lessons:**
    1.  **Constitutional Convention Simulation:** Students are assigned roles (e.g., "Delegate from a Large State," "Delegate from a Small State") and debate key issues from the Constitutional Convention. This a hands-on way to understand the compromises and competing interests that structured our government.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `SS4H2.b`, `SS4CG3.a`

    2.  **Argument "Deconstruction" Team:** Using an age-appropriate opinion article (e.g., "Why Our Town Needs a New Skatepark"), students work in teams to identify the author's main claim, the reasons they provide, and the evidence used to support those reasons. This directly models the skills they will need for their own proposals.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.T.T.3.a`, `4.P.ST.2`

    3.  **Polygon Classification Agency:** Students act as agents for the "Polygon Classification Agency." Given a set of various polygons, they must sort and classify them based on their properties (number of sides, lines of symmetry, presence of parallel/perpendicular lines, types of angles), explaining the "rules" for their classification system.
        *   **Primary Standard:** `4.GSR.8.2`

    4.  **The Gravity Argument:** Students design and conduct a simple experiment to support the claim that gravity is a force that pulls objects toward Earth. They might drop two objects of different mass but similar shape (e.g., a golf ball and a ping-pong ball) and write a scientific argument explaining their observations and conclusion.
        *   **Primary Standard:** `S4P3.b`

    5.  **Connecting Ideas with Conjunctions:** Students practice joining simple sentences into more complex, flowing ideas using relative pronouns ("The man *who* signed the Declaration...") and subordinating conjunctions ("*Although* the states had different ideas, they reached a compromise."). This builds the grammatical structure needed for sophisticated writing.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.L.GC.1.31`, `4.L.GC.1.39`

#### **Phase 3: Constructing & Proposing Our Monument**

This is the synthesis phase where students apply everything they have learned to create their final project. The activities are scaffolded steps toward completing the performance task.

*   **Key Activities & Lessons:**
    1.  **Monument Design Charrette:** In their final project teams, students select a specific right from the Bill of Rights (`SS4CG2`, `SS4CG3.b`). They brainstorm how to represent this abstract idea (e.g., freedom of speech, right to assemble) using geometric shapes and forms. They create initial sketches of their monument design.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `SS4CG2`, `SS4CG3.b`

    2.  **Simple Machine-Powered Models:** Teams build 3D models of their monument designs. The challenge is to creatively and meaningfully incorporate at least one simple machine (e.g., a lever that moves part of the monument, a ramp as a central feature). They must measure the angles used in their design and calculate the area/perimeter of the monument's base.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `S4P3.c`, `4.GSR.7.2`, `4.GSR.8.3`

    3.  **Persuasive Proposal Writing Workshop:** Students draft their proposals to the "Community Leaders Panel." We hold mini-lessons on writing a strong introduction, stating a clear opinion, supporting it with reasons from their study of the Bill of Rights, using linking words to connect ideas, and writing a powerful conclusion. Peer editing focuses on using varied sentence structures and correct pronoun-antecedent agreement.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.T.T.3.c`, `4.L.GC.2.b`, `4.T.T.2.d`

    4.  **The Monument Expo (Final Presentations):** Teams present their final projects. They unveil their physical model and deliver a persuasive speech based on their written proposal. They must argue *why* their chosen right is important and *how* their monument's structure and design effectively represent that right. The panel asks questions, and students must defend their design choices.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.MP.3`, `S4P3` (communicating info), `4.T.T.3.c`
