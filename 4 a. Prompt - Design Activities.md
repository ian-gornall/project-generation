ROLE:
You are an expert 4th-grade master teacher and curriculum designer, writing a detailed, practical weekly lesson plan.

TASK:
I am providing you with all the necessary context for a single phase of a larger project. Your task is to design a complete plan for **Week 1 ONLY** of this phase. The plan must include a high-level Weekly Overview followed by five detailed Daily Lesson Plans.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Adhere strictly to the provided structure.
- Ensure every activity in the daily plans directly addresses one or more standards from the "Sequenced Standards List."
- Explicitly incorporate ideas for Differentiation and Spiral Review into the daily plans.
- Make the activities engaging, varied, and practical for a real classroom.

### CONTEXT & INPUTS ###
---

**[ PASTE INPUT 1 HERE: Overall Project & Phase Concept ]**
*(This is the high-level project information. Paste the output you received from the prompt that gave you the "Overall Project Concept" and the "Unit Phases & Instructional Sequence" with activity ideas.)*

**EXAMPLE:**
> **Project Title:** The Monument to a More Perfect Union
> **Essential Question:** How can we use the principles of structure, balance, and force...
> **Phase 1 Title:** Foundations of Force & Form
> **Phase 1 Goal:** To build foundational, discrete skills in physical science, geometry, and government...
> **Phase 1 Key Activity Ideas:** Simple Machine Labs, Geometry Boot Camp...

---

**[ PASTE INPUT 2 HERE: Sequenced Standards List for this Phase ]**
*(This is the rigorous, complete list of standards for this specific phase. Paste the output you received from the "Sequencing First" prompt that just lists the standards.)*

**EXAMPLE:**
> ### Phase 1: Foundational Concepts
> - **Mathematics**
>   - `4.GSR.7.1`: Recognize angles as geometric shapes...
>   - `4.GSR.7.2`: Measure angles in reference to a circle...
> - **Science**
>   - `S4P3.c`: Ask questions to identify and explain the uses of simple machines...
> ... and so on for all standards in this phase.

**[ INPUT 3: Estimated Phase Length ]**
*   **Estimated Length of this Phase:** Based on the number of standards in Input 2, we will plan for **[Manually enter your estimate, e.g., "3 weeks"]**. We are currently planning **Week 1**.

*   **Weekly Narrative & Flow:** [Describe the story of the week and how the subjects connect.]
*   **Differentiation & Spiral Review Plan:** [List specific strategies for support, enrichment, and reviewing prior concepts.]

**Part 2: Daily Lesson Plans**

(Use the following structure for all 5 days)

### Day X: [Day's Focus Title]

*   **Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to... [Specific, measurable objective]
*   **Primary Standard(s) Addressed:** `[Code]`, `[Code]`
*   **Materials:** [Bulleted list]
*   **Lesson Plan:**
    1.  **Warm-Up / Spiral Review (10 min):** [Specific activity reviewing a past skill.]
    2.  **Direct Instruction (15 min):** [Teacher-led introduction of a new concept.]
    3.  **Guided Practice (20 min):** [Whole-group or pair work with teacher support.]
    4.  **Independent Practice / Activity (30 min):** [Main task for the day. Include differentiation notes.]
    5.  **Exit Ticket (5 min):** [Quick check for understanding.]
