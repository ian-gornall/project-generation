### **1. Overall Project Concept**

*   **Project Title:** The American Storytellers' Museum
*   **Essential Question:** Whose story is it? How do the stories we tell (and the ones we don't) shape who we are as a nation?
*   **Final Project "Performance Task":** Students will curate and create a multi-modal museum exhibit that tells the story of a specific event or perspective from America's formative years, combining a written historical narrative, a geographical map, and a data-driven infographic.

### **2. Detailed Phases & Activities**

#### **Phase 1: Becoming Historians & Storytellers**
*(This phase focuses on building the foundational skills and community necessary for the project. We are "tooling up" to become researchers, storytellers, and mathematicians.)*

*   **Key Activities & Lessons:**
    1.  **Activity: Our Storytellers' Notebook.** Students create and personalize a physical notebook that will be their home base for the quarter. In the first section, they set reading/writing goals, list their favorite genres, and reflect on their identity as a reader and writer. They will practice cursive by copying short, powerful quotes from historical figures we will study later. Regular "Author's Chair" sessions where students share their notebook entries will build our classroom community.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.P.EICC.1.a, b, e, f`; `4.F.H.4.a, b`
    2.  **Activity: Mapping a Nation by the Numbers.** Using large physical or digital maps of the United States, students work in teams to locate the major physical and man-made features listed in the standards. For each of the six specified cities, teams will research its founding-era population and its current population. They will write these multi-digit numbers in standard and expanded form and use comparison symbols (>, <, =) to order the cities by population, creating a "Top 6" list for both eras.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `SS4G1.a, b`; `4.NR.1.1`; `4.NR.1.3`
    3.  **Activity: The Classroom Ecosystem.** We model the roles of producer, consumer, and decomposer using the classroom community itself. "Producers" (e.g., the teacher providing a lesson), "Consumers" (students "taking in" the knowledge), and "Decomposers" (students who help break down confusing ideas for peers) are identified. Students then create a simple model of a *natural* ecosystem (e.g., a forest), drawing and labeling the roles. They write a descriptive paragraph for each role, ensuring they use linking and helping verbs correctly.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `S4L1.a`; `4.L.GC.1.33`
    4.  **Activity: History's Word Detectives.** Students engage in a learning station with "case files" containing sentences about early American life. These sentences have common errors. Students must work as detectives to find and correct the frequently confused words (there/their/they're) and add apostrophes to show plural possessives (e.g., changing "The many colonists hats" to "The many colonists' hats").
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.L.GC.1.34`; `4.L.GC.1.37`

#### **Phase 2: The Revolution of Stories**
*(In this phase, students dive into the complex narratives of the American Revolution, learning to analyze events from multiple perspectives and use math to understand the scale of the conflict.)*

*   **Key Activities & Lessons:**
    1.  **Activity: A Revolutionary Debate in Two Voices.** After learning about events like the Stamp Act and the Boston Tea Party through primary source excerpts and historical texts, students work in pairs. One student takes the perspective of a Patriot Colonist, and the other takes the perspective of a British Loyalist. They co-write a "Two-Voice Poem" that presents both viewpoints on the event, focusing on using dialogue conventions (quotation marks, commas) and identifying the different motivations of their characters (protagonist/antagonist).
        *   **Primary Standards:** `SS4H1.a, b`; `4.T.C.2.a`; `4.T.T.1.b`; `4.L.GC.1.30`
    2.  **Activity: Battle Plan Mathematics.** Using maps of key battle sites (Lexington & Concord, Saratoga), students analyze the terrain. They first explain how geography (hills, rivers, forests) was used by each side. Then, they solve a series of word problems related to the battle. *Example: "If 3 British regiments of 650 soldiers each marched on Concord, how many soldiers were there in total? If a colonial militia was only 1/10th that size, how many militia members were there?"* This grounds multiplication and comparison in a historical context.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `SS4G2.a`; `SS4H1.c`; `4.NR.2.2`; `4.NR.2.3`
    3.  **Activity: Food Web of Power.** Students first model the flow of energy in a colonial-era ecosystem (e.g., New England forest), creating a food web diagram that shows the interdependence of organisms. We then use this as a metaphor to analyze the Declaration of Independence. Students create a conceptual "Web of Power" showing the relationships between King George III (at the top), Parliament, Colonial Governors, and the Colonists. This visually represents the "abuse of power" and helps them identify the central themes of the conflict.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `S4L1.b`; `SS4H1.d`; `4.T.T.1.c`
    4.  **Activity: Finding Figurative Language in Fiery Speeches.** Students read excerpts from famous revolutionary speeches, like Patrick Henry's "Give me liberty, or give me death!" They hunt for and highlight examples of figurative language (hyperbole, personification) and powerful word choice (interjections like "Alas!"). They discuss how these techniques were used to persuade the audience and convey a strong sense of purpose.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.T.SS.2.a`; `4.T.C.1.a`; `4.L.GC.1.32`

#### **Phase 3: Forging a New Nation: Trails, Trade, & Tales**
*(This is the synthesis and application phase. Students explore the complexities of expansion and economics, culminating in the creation of their final museum exhibit.)*

*   **Key Activities & Lessons:**
    1.  **Activity: The Oregon Trail Budget Challenge.** In small groups, students are given a starting budget of $600 to "outfit a wagon" for the journey west. They are given a price list for supplies (oxen, flour, tools, etc.) and must make choices. This introduces **opportunity cost** (if we buy an extra rifle, we can't afford the extra barrel of flour). They then solve multi-step problems about their journey, such as calculating the total distance traveled over 3 weeks or dividing their remaining food supplies after a mishap.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `SS4H3.c`; `SS4E1.a, d`; `4.NR.2.5`; `4.MDR.6.1`
    2.  **Activity: An Ecosystem in Crisis Model.** Students investigate the impact of westward expansion on the Great Plains. Using historical data and maps, they model the dramatic change in the ecosystem caused by the near-extinction of the bison. They create a cause-and-effect flow chart demonstrating how the railroad and over-hunting (the change) broke the energy flow for Native American tribes (like the Lakota), leading to their forced relocation.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `S4L1.c, d`; `SS4H3.b`; `SS4G2.b`
    3.  **Activity: Museum Exhibit Workshop.** This is the core work block for the final performance task. Students choose their exhibit topic (e.g., The Gold Rush Miner, a Daughter of Liberty, a Cherokee child on the Trail of Tears, a Lewis and Clark expedition member). They conduct research, draft their historical narrative from that perspective (`4.T.T.1.e`), create a map showing the key geography of their story, and design an infographic using relevant data (e.g., cost of goods, miles traveled, population changes). They engage in peer feedback sessions to revise and improve their work for the final presentation.
        *   **Primary Standards:** `4.P.EICC.2.a-e` (all sub-standards); `4.T.T.1.e`; `4.T.C.1.c`; `SS4E1.c, f`
    4.  **Culminating Event: The American Storytellers' Museum Gallery Walk.** We transform the classroom into a museum. Students set up their tri-fold exhibits. We invite other classes, parents, and administrators to be "patrons." Students stand by their exhibits, present their narratives to small groups, explain their data, and answer questions from the audience, fulfilling their role as both author and expert.
        *   **Primary Standards:** This activity serves as the summative assessment for the entire unit, touching on nearly all standards, with a special focus on communication and synthesis.
