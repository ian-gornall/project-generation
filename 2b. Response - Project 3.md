### **Project-Based Learning Unit Plan**

### **1. Overall Project Concept**

*   **Project Title:** Forces of Change: A Museum of Natural and Social Transformation
*   **Essential Question:** What forces—natural and human—cause significant change, and how do we measure and communicate their impact?
*   **Final Project "Performance Task":** Working in collaborative research teams, students will create a "Forces of Change" museum exhibit, with each team contributing an interactive display about a specific scientific or historical topic that showcases research, a data visualization, and a physical model or artifact.

### **2. Unit Phases & Instructional Sequence**

This 9-week unit is broken into three distinct phases, moving from foundational knowledge to application and synthesis.

---

#### **Phase 1: Understanding Parts of a Whole & The Nature of Change (Weeks 1-3)**

*   **Phase Goal:** Students will build foundational knowledge about fractions as parts of a whole, the key elements of the water cycle, and the initial context of the major social changes in 19th-century America. They will also learn the fundamental skills of inquiry and identifying credible sources.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**
    1.  **Direct Instruction (Math): Building Fraction Sense.** Using fraction tiles, number lines, and drawings, students learn to represent fractions, identify unit fractions, and find simple equivalencies. This is pure, direct instruction to build the conceptual foundation. (`4.NR.4.1`, `4.NR.4.4`)
    2.  **Direct Instruction (ELA): Asking Powerful Questions.** The teacher models how to move from a topic (e.g., "rain") to a researchable, open-ended question ("What causes rain to fall in some places but not others?"). Students practice generating questions about familiar topics. (`4.T.RA.1.a`)
    3.  **Skill Building (Science): Water Cycle Investigations.** Students conduct hands-on investigations to observe evaporation (wet sponge on a plate), condensation (ice water in a cup), and precipitation. They will develop and label a model of the water cycle. This provides a concrete, observable "force of change" to study. (`S4E3.a`, `S4E3.b`)
    4.  **Skill Building (Social Studies/ELA): Reading for Context.** Through teacher read-alouds and shared reading of age-appropriate texts, students are introduced to key figures of the abolitionist and suffrage movements (Tubman, Douglass, Truth, Anthony, Stanton). The focus is on understanding the challenges they faced and the changes they sought. (`SS4H4.a`, `4.T.RA.2.a`)
    5.  **Direct Instruction (ELA): What is a Credible Source?** A mini-lesson on distinguishing between sources (e.g., a university website vs. a random blog) and identifying an author's purpose. Students practice evaluating simple sources provided by the teacher. (`4.T.RA.2.b`)

---

#### **Phase 2: Comparing, Connecting, and Deepening Understanding (Weeks 4-6)**

*   **Phase Goal:** Students will move from foundational knowledge to more complex skills, such as comparing fractions and decimals, analyzing causes and effects in history, and designing scientific investigations for light and sound. The final project is officially launched at the end of this phase.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**
    1.  **Direct Instruction (Math): Comparing & Connecting Numbers.** Students learn strategies to compare fractions with different numerators/denominators. This is followed by direct instruction on the relationship between fractions with denominators of 10/100 and decimals, using place value charts and grid models. (`4.NR.4.2`, `4.NR.4.3`, `4.NR.5.1`, `4.NR.5.2`, `4.NR.5.3`)
    2.  **Skill Building (ELA/SS): Compare & Contrast Writing.** After a mini-lesson on using comparative/superlative adjectives (`4.L.GC.1.28`) and transition words (`4.T.SS.1.c`), students write a paragraph comparing the arguments for states' rights versus the arguments against slavery, or comparing the contributions of two different abolitionists. (`SS4H5.b`)
    3.  **Application (Science): Light & Sound Labs.** In small groups, students investigate how light interacts with different materials (opaque, translucent, transparent) and how sound vibrations can be changed. This hands-on work provides ideas for the "model/artifact" portion of their final project. (`S4P1.a`, `S4P2.a`)
    4.  **Direct Instruction (ELA): Organizing Information.** The teacher models how to synthesize information from two different sources on the same topic (e.g., John Brown's raid) into a cohesive set of notes, identifying key details that support the main idea. (`4.T.T.2.c`, `4.T.SS.1.a`)
    5.  **Project Launch:** The teacher formally introduces the "Forces of Change Museum" project. Students see exemplars from previous years. Research teams are formed, and groups choose or are assigned a specific topic (e.g., The Atlanta Campaign, The Water Cycle, How Light & Sound Communicate, The 15th Amendment, Sharecropping). They establish group norms and begin brainstorming questions. (`4.P.CP.1.b`)

#### **Phase 3: Application, Synthesis, and Creation (Weeks 7-9)**

*   **Phase Goal:** Students will work collaboratively in their project teams to apply all the skills learned in the previous phases. The teacher's role shifts to that of a facilitator, providing targeted support through conferences and workshops.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**
    1.  **Application (Project Work Time): Research & Development.** Student teams conduct their research, gather information from multiple sources, and begin designing their exhibit. This is the central activity of the phase. (`4.T.RA.1.b`, `4.T.RA.1.c`, `4.P.CP.1.a`, `4.P.CP.1.c`, `4.P.CP.1.d`)
    2.  **Differentiated Workshop (Math): Fractions & Data in Action.** The teacher pulls small groups for "just-in-time" mini-lessons.
        *   One workshop focuses on adding/subtracting fractions with like denominators to solve project-related problems (e.g., "Our poster is 8/8. The text takes up 3/8 and the map takes up 4/8. How much space is left?"). (`4.NR.4.6`)
        *   Another workshop focuses on creating a dot plot to display a set of numerical data relevant to their topic (e.g., casualties in major battles, yearly rainfall in a region). (`4.MDR.6.3`)
    3.  **Application (ELA): Drafting the Museum Placard.** Students write the informational text for their exhibit. They focus on crafting cohesive paragraphs with transitions and using a clear text structure (e.g., chronological for a battle, cause/effect for a social movement). The teacher holds writing conferences to provide feedback. (`4.T.SS.1.b`, `4.T.SS.1.d`, `4.F.P.4`)
    4.  **Application (Science/Art): Constructing the Model/Artifact.** Teams build their physical component. This could be a diorama of a Civil War battle, a working model showing light refraction, or a simple device to communicate using sound as per `S4P2.b`. This is a highly engaging, hands-on application of their research.
    5.  **Presentation & Reflection:** In the final week, teams rehearse their presentations. The unit culminates in the **"Forces of Change Museum Day,"** where students present their exhibits to another class, parents, or school leaders. They must answer questions based on their research and data (`4.MDR.6.2`). The unit concludes with a written reflection on the essential question.
