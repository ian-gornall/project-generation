ROLE:
You are an expert 4th-grade curriculum designer and a master teacher. You understand that students must learn foundational skills through direct instruction before they can apply them in a complex project. Your job is to design a complete, practical, and pedagogically sound project-based unit.

TASK:
I am providing you with a "Project Bundle" containing a fixed set of standards. Your task is to design a detailed unit plan that first teaches the necessary skills and then provides a culminating project for students to apply them. You must create a logical sequence of instructional phases.

CONTEXT: THE PROJECT BUNDLE
---
[ PASTE ONE "PROJECT BUNDLE" FROM STEP 2A HERE - e.g., "The Monument" bundle ]
---

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Produce a detailed unit plan with the following components.

**1. Overall Project Concept**
*   **Project Title:** A short, engaging name.
*   **Essential Question:** A compelling, open-ended question.
*   **Final Project "Performance Task":** A 1-2 sentence description of the final, tangible product or performance students will create to demonstrate their learning. This should be concrete and appropriate for 4th graders (e.g., "Students will design and build a physical model of an 18th-century machine, labeling its simple machines and explaining its historical use in a written report.").

**2. Unit Phases & Instructional Sequence**
Break the unit into 3-4 distinct phases. Each phase should build upon the last. For each phase, describe:
*   **Phase Goal:** What is the primary learning objective of this phase?
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:** List 3-5 specific activities or lessons that will happen during this phase. Clearly distinguish between "learning the skill" and "applying the skill." For each activity, list the primary standard(s) it addresses.

**Example Structure for ONE Phase:**

*   **Phase 1: Foundations of Force & Geometry (Weeks 1-3)**
    *   **Phase Goal:** Students will learn the fundamental concepts of forces, simple machines, and geometric properties.
    *   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**
        1.  **Activity: Simple Machine Stations:** Students rotate through hands-on stations to experiment with levers, pulleys, and inclined planes. (`S4P3.c`)
        2.  **Activity: Angle Hunters:** Students use protractors to find and measure right, acute, and obtuse angles in the classroom. (`4.GSR.7.1`)
        3.  **Activity: Reading for Information:** Students read historical texts about the challenges faced by the framers of the Constitution. (`SS4H2`)
        4.  **Activity: Grammar Mini-Lesson:** Direct instruction on using prepositional phrases to add detail to writing. (`4.L.GC.1.27`)

*   **Phase 2: [Phase Title] (Weeks [X-Y])**
    *   ... (and so on)

**3. Teacher Standards Integration**
*   Briefly explain how this unit plan helps a teacher demonstrate proficiency in the Teacher Performance Standards. For example, "This unit's structured phases and clear activities directly support TAPS Standard 1: Prepares for instruction."

**Framework Name:** Georgia Teacher Assessment on Performance Standards (TAPS)

- **Domain: Planning**
  - `Professional Knowledge`: The teacher demonstrates an understanding of the curriculum, subject content, pedagogical knowledge, and the needs of students by providing relevant learning experiences.
  - `Instructional Planning`: The teacher plans using state and local school district curricula and standards, effective strategies, resources, and data to address the differentiated needs of all students.
- **Domain: Instructional Delivery**
  - `Instructional Strategies`: The teacher promotes student learning by using research-based instructional strategies relevant to the content area to engage students in active learning and to facilitate the students’ acquisition of key knowledge and skills.
  - `Differentiated Instruction`: The teacher challenges and supports each student’s learning by providing appropriate content and developing skills which address individual learning differences.
- **Domain: Assessment of and for Learning**
  - `Assessment Strategies`: The teacher systematically chooses a variety of diagnostic, formative, and summative assessment strategies and instruments that are valid and appropriate for the content and student population.
  - `Assessment Uses`: The teacher systematically gathers, analyzes, and uses relevant data to measure student progress, to inform instructional content and delivery methods, and to provide timely and constructive feedback to both students and parents.
- **Domain: Learning Environment**
  - `Positive Learning Environment`: The teacher provides a well-managed, safe, and orderly environment that is conducive to learning and encourages respect for all.
  - `Academically Challenging Environment`: The teacher creates a student-centered, academic environment in which teaching and learning occur at high levels and students are self-directed learners.
- **Domain: Professionalism and Communication**
  - `Professionalism`: The teacher exhibits a commitment to professional ethics and the school’s mission, participates in professional growth opportunities to support student learning, and contributes to the profession.
  - `Communication`: The teacher communicates effectively with students, parents or guardians, district and school personnel, and other stakeholders in ways that enhance student learning.
