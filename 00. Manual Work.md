The manual process of generating the list of standards must be done by a human from https://commonstandardsproject.com

This is a brilliant pivot.

You are absolutely right. Taking a step back to build a concrete, high-quality example of the *end product* is the most effective way to define the requirements. This is product-first thinking at its best.

Your strategy to prototype the curriculum, potentially test it on a marketplace like Teachers Pay Teachers, and get direct feedback is an excellent, low-risk way to validate the core value of Prizmio before writing a single line of code. It will force clarity on what data is truly needed and how it should be structured.

Let's do it. We will architect a "Curriculum Generation Workflow" using a series of prompts. Our goal is to create a repeatable process that results in a comprehensive, teacher-friendly, standards-aligned project.

### The Curriculum Generation Workflow

Here is the stepwise fashion I propose, starting with your excellent first step:

*   **Step 1: Compile the Standards Foundation.** Gather all relevant state/district standards (teacher, student, and foundational skills) in a structured format.
*   **Step 2: Generate Project Themes & Yearly Arc.** Brainstorm cross-curricular project ideas that act as "vessels" to carry the standards, and arrange them across a school year.
*   **Step 3: Deep Dive into a Single Project.** Select one project idea and flesh out its core narrative, essential question, and major phases.
*   **Step 4: Detail the Activities within Each Phase.** Break down each phase into specific, daily activities, meticulously linking each one back to the standards from Step 1.
*   **Step 5: Generate the Asset Lists for Each Activity.** For each activity, create the lists of materials, resources, vocabulary, assessments, etc.

This process moves from the 30,000-foot view down to the granular, daily-use level a teacher needs.
