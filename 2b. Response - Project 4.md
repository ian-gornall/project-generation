### **Project-Based Learning Unit Plan**

### 1. Overall Project Concept

*   **Project Title:** Mission Control: Our Community's Journey to the Stars
*   **Essential Question:** How can we, as a community of explorers, plan a successful mission to a new world and share our discoveries with others?
*   **Final Project "Performance Task":** Students will work in collaborative "Mission Teams" to research, design, and budget a scientific mission to Mars, presenting their comprehensive proposal in a multimodal format to a "NASA Funding Committee" (composed of teachers, school leaders, and/or parents).

### 2. Unit Phases & Instructional Sequence (9-Week Unit)

This unit is structured into three distinct phases, moving from foundational knowledge-building to complex application and synthesis.

---

#### **Phase 1: Cadet Training – Building Foundational Knowledge (Weeks 1-3)**

*   **Phase Goal:** Students will acquire the foundational scientific knowledge about our solar system and weather, while simultaneously learning and practicing the core ELA skills of reading for information, vocabulary acquisition, and comprehension.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**

    1.  **Learning the Skill (Science & ELA): Reading Like a Scientist.**
        *   **Direct Instruction:** The teacher introduces strategies for reading complex informational texts. Mini-lessons focus on setting a purpose for reading, scanning for key terms, summarizing sections, and identifying text structures like compare/contrast and cause/effect. (`4.P.EICC.3.a, b, d`)
        *   **Direct Instruction:** The teacher explicitly teaches key academic vocabulary and Greek/Latin roots related to space (e.g., *astro*, *tele*, *sol*, *luna*, *graph*). Students create a "Space Dictionary" in their notebooks. (`4.L.V.1.a`, `4.L.V.2.a`)

    2.  **Applying the Skill (Science & ELA): Our Place in the Cosmos.**
        *   **Activity:** Using a variety of grade-level texts, videos, and models, students learn the differences between stars and planets, the relative order and attributes of the planets, and why the sun appears brighter than other stars. They apply their reading strategies to complete graphic organizers comparing and contrasting celestial bodies. (`S4E1.c, d`, `S4E1.b`)

    3.  **Learning the Skill (ELA): Fluency & Prosody.**
        *   **Direct Instruction:** The teacher models fluent reading with proper prosody (expression, phrasing, intonation) using engaging, space-themed informational passages or poetry. Students learn how to self-correct when reading aloud. (`4.F.F.1.c, d`)
        *   **Activity:** Students engage in "Partner Reading" and "Choral Reading" of space-themed texts to build automaticity and accuracy. (`4.F.F.1.a, b`)

    4.  **Learning the Skill (Social Studies & Math): Introduction to Budgeting.**
        *   **Direct Instruction:** The teacher introduces the core concepts of a personal budget: income, expenditures, and savings. The class collaboratively creates a simple budget for a hypothetical classroom party to understand the core principles. (`SS4E2`)
        *   **Direct Instruction:** The teacher demonstrates how to use a simple spreadsheet or table (e.g., in Google Sheets or a Word document) as a tool for organizing financial data, emphasizing precision and clear labels. (`4.MP.5`, `4.MP.6`)

    5.  **Applying the Skill (Science): Daily Weather Watch.**
        *   **Activity:** The class begins a daily routine of recording weather data (temperature, cloud types, precipitation) using a school weather station or online data. This builds a long-term dataset and introduces the use of weather instruments. (`S4E4.a`, `S4E4.c`)

---

#### **Phase 2: Mission Planning – Research & Collaboration (Weeks 4-6)**

*   **Phase Goal:** Students will transition from general knowledge to specific research, working in collaborative teams to plan the key components of their Mars mission while learning and applying the full writing process.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**

    1.  **Project Launch & Team Formation.**
        *   **Activity:** The teacher formally introduces the "Mission Control" project. Students are grouped into "Mission Teams" of 4-5 and choose roles (e.g., Lead Scientist, Communications Director, Budget Officer, Lead Engineer) to foster a sense of community and shared purpose.

    2.  **Learning the Skill (ELA): The Writing Process for a Proposal.**
        *   **Direct Instruction:** The teacher explicitly teaches the stages of the writing process in the context of creating a formal proposal. Mini-lessons cover: establishing purpose and audience, brainstorming, gathering and citing information from multiple texts, and creating an organized plan/outline. (`4.P.EICC.4.a, b, c, d`)

    3.  **Applying the Skill (ELA, Science, Math): The Research & Drafting Phase.**
        *   **Activity:** Teams begin researching their Mars mission. They use their comprehension strategies (`4.P.EICC.3`) to find answers to key questions (e.g., *What is the climate on Mars?* (`S4E4.d`), *What technology is needed for the journey?* (`S4E1.a`), *What are the effects of Earth's tilt and orbit on launch windows?* (`S4E2.c`)).
        *   **Activity:** Teams begin constructing the initial drafts of their proposal, integrating their research. The Budget Officer uses a provided template and "price list" to create a mission budget, applying their understanding of expenditures with precision. (`4.P.EICC.4.e`, `SS4E2`, `4.MP.6`)

    4.  **Learning the Skill (ELA): Writing Like a Reader & Author's Craft.**
        *   **Direct Instruction:** Mini-lessons focus on author's craft. Students analyze examples of persuasive writing and scientific reports to see how authors use precise vocabulary, sentence structure, and organizational features (headings, diagrams) to inform and persuade an audience. (`4.P.AC.1.a, b, d`)

    5.  **Applying the Skill (ELA): Crafting a Compelling Narrative.**
        *   **Activity:** Students work on their drafts with a focus on audience and purpose. They consciously select powerful words, use scientific vocabulary correctly, and structure their text to be both informative and exciting, in order to convince the "Funding Committee." (`4.P.AC.2.a, b, d`, `4.L.V.1.b`)

#### **Phase 3: Final Approach – Synthesis, Revision, & Rehearsal (Weeks 7-9)**

*   **Phase Goal:** Students will refine their written work, synthesize it into a polished multimodal presentation, and practice their public speaking skills to prepare for the final showcase.
*   **Key Activities & Direct Instruction:**

    1.  **Learning the Skill (ELA): Revision & Editing.**
        *   **Direct Instruction:** The teacher models how to evaluate a text for effectiveness using a rubric. Students learn how to give and receive constructive feedback. Mini-lessons focus on peer revision strategies and editing for grammar, spelling, and punctuation. (`4.P.EICC.4.f, g, h`)

    2.  **Applying the Skill (ELA): Peer Review Workshops.**
        *   **Activity:** Teams engage in a structured peer-review process, using checklists and rubrics to provide feedback on each other's written proposals. They then revise and edit their work based on this feedback, creating a final, polished document.

    3.  **Learning the Skill (ELA): Multimodal Text Design & Presentation.**
        *   **Direct Instruction:** The teacher provides lessons on effective presentation design. This includes how to choose impactful images, use limited text on slides, and integrate different modes (e.g., speaking, visuals, a physical model) to achieve a purpose. (`4.P.AC.3.d`, `4.P.CP.2.b`)

    4.  **Applying the Skill (ELA & All Content): Creating & Rehearsing the Presentation.**
        *   **Activity:** Teams synthesize their written proposal into a multimodal presentation (e.g., Google Slides, poster board showcase). They practice their delivery, focusing on clear communication, appropriate tone and pace, and engaging with the audience by anticipating questions. (`4.P.CP.2.a, c, d`)

    5.  **Summative Performance Task: The Mission Proposal Showcase.**
        *   **Final Event:** Teams present their final, polished Mars Mission Proposal to the "NASA Funding Committee." This event serves as the summative assessment for the entire unit, evaluating their understanding of the science content, budgeting, and their mastery of the ELA research, writing, and presentation standards.
